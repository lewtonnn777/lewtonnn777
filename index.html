      <p>So without further ado I’d like to deliver the news you’ve been waiting for...</p>
      <h4><strong>Could “Healing Sleep” Be The Undiscovered Fountain Of Youth?</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>Dr Matthew Walker</strong> seems to think so. </p>
      <p>Dr Walker is one of the world’s leading sleep scientists and researchers. He runs a sleep research laboratory and has a team of dedicated scientists at the <strong>Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley.</strong> </p>
      <p>He has devoted over <strong>20 years to sleep research </strong>and <strong>published over 100 scientific studies</strong>....</p>

      <p>And his new research is sending shockwaves through the medical community. Because he has discovered a powerful link between the lack of <strong>Healing Sleep</strong> and many of the most common diseases and harmful behaviours.</p>
      <p>Things like: </p>
      <p>Psychiatric disorders,General cognitive decline, Cancer, Depression, Obesity, Risky behaviour, Post-traumatic stress disorder, Learning and memory loss. </p>
      <p>And last year, he found a link between poor sleep and the build-up of a protein directly linked to Alzheimer’s!</p>
      <p>I’ll tell you exactly how and why this happens and - more importantly - how to stop and reverse it… in just a second...</p>
      <p>You see, what used to be thought of by the medical community as old age related diseases now are now considered a symptom of <strong>Healing Sleep</strong> deprivation by many of the most savvy health professionals.</p>
      <p>And what’s more...</p>
      <p>And before I tell you the rest of the story… all I ask of you is that you share this message with at least one person on your social media network, so that I can help more people recover their lost vitality and well being…</p>

        <h2><strong>The Plague Of “Sleep Debt”</strong></h2>
        <p>It also appears that lack of <strong>Healing Sleep</strong> builds up what could be called <strong>Sleep Debt</strong>. </p>
        <p><strong>Sleep Debt</strong> is a layer of toxins, beta-amyloids, damaging molecules and environmental poisons that accumulate in your brain which speeds up almost all of the natural aging processes. And now - evidence shows - that it may be the cause of <strong>Alzheimer&#x27;s disease</strong>. </p>

        <p>It literally melts away your neural connections and even neurons themselves. </p>
        <p>If you have struggled with lapses of memory it may not be your fault, it could be that the memory cannot be stored do to a chemical buildup in your brain. </p>
        <p>If you get anything less than 7.5 hours of deep undisturbed and <strong>Healing Sleep</strong> every night then you are building up deadly <strong>Sleep Debt</strong> right now. </p>
        <p>If think you may be in this group - don’t worry I will reveal exactly how you can clear your <strong>Sleep Debt </strong>quickly… from the comfort of your own home. </p>
        <h4><strong>What Exactly Is “Healing Sleep”?</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>Healing Sleep</strong> only takes place during 2 specific sleep stages... Which is why just falling asleep may not provide any <strong>Healing Sleep</strong> at all.</p>
        <p>During a regular sleep period your body goes through 5 distinct sleep stages called - <strong>I</strong>, <strong>II</strong>, <strong>III</strong>, <strong>IV</strong> and <strong>REM</strong> (Rapid Eye Movement).</p>
        <p>Please look at the sleep diagram called “hypnogram” below to see how a night of health sleep should look like…</p>
        <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rGleK1jogHrtQJauMwEzbDh4sG3E47k83GODq8AX3Q0s8zcmoESgX1UC5XXTA8q8jsXY6zSpkXINgsblnq7FOlWQnR9z5RQ3CIBJmak6N3f-OApRcT8eTVudw8ZGCsdAg9P2EXs9" alt="Hypnogram - Healing Sleep.png"></div>
        </figure>
        <p>[CAPTION This pattern may look chaotic and irregular but it’s how a full night of high quality sleep should look like.]</p>
        <p>If you look closely, you can see that you spend a little time in every single stage. However there are two stages that you should pay special attention to, because that is where most of the healing takes place. </p>
        <p>And these stages are... </p>
        <p><strong>Stage IV</strong> and <strong>REM</strong>. (That’s the very top and the very bottom of the graph)</p>
        <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4B6Mt4Fg0Q_rAHrqEBqRkxojGC9Qg4clF_jNNQviUcuOS6WTh1fuou61eAQEM8IumKWPY42-b-bqgsZRb-LPQjRm2TadIwpYMbKL7C2TaHPHLU9TgQyIvZRPzPuiYJwecmPyuOz5" alt="Hypnogram - Healing Sleep - highlighted.png"></div>
        </figure>
        <p>{CAPTION:} Here you can see <strong>REM</strong> and <strong>Stage IV</strong> highlighted - these two stages are what <strong>Healing</strong> <strong>Sleep</strong> is. </p>
        <p>And let me tell you why:</p>
        <p>If you scanned your brain during these sleep stages you’d see increased <strong>alpha-wave activity</strong>. </p>
        <p>Now this is important, because <strong>alpha waves</strong> are the electrical signals produced by the brain during a <strong>relaxed and healing state</strong>. It’s how your body and brain behave when all is well.</p>
        <p>Here’s what <strong>Dr Matthew Walker</strong>, (the Neuroscientist we met earlier) reveals in his book about these two healing sleep stages: </p>
        <h4><strong>Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams</strong></h4>
        <p>Here’s why these two Healing Sleep stages are so vital to your health and well being...</p>
        <p><strong>Stage IV (and III) Sleep</strong></p>
        <p>Your brain <strong>organises and catalogs</strong> your entire day’s memories and experiencesThe <strong>memories are clarified</strong> which is why you can sometimes recall an old memory clear as day<strong>meaning is added to all your day’s memories</strong> so you can <strong>use them to become smarter and learn</strong> (because information without meaning is... meaningless)The <strong>valuable memories get stored</strong> in LTS (long term storage) and…The the bad, unhelpful memories (like the smell of trash you walked past that morning or anxieties of the day) get erased to <strong>make more space for new good and happy memories</strong></p>
        <p><strong>REM Sleep (The dreaming sleep stage)</strong></p>
        <p>Your brain takes every bit of your new day’s knowledge and <strong>compares</strong> and <strong>pairs</strong> it with every other memory you have making <strong>millions of new neural connections in your brain</strong> (this is one of the reasons why you have dreams). <strong>This builds your creativity</strong> through metaphors, analogies and similarities between different life situations. It prepares all of the information you have learned that day and <strong>“labels it” for rapid access when you need it</strong>, (this is how you get insights and “wisdom” and also how you learn new skills)It <strong>extracts</strong> the <strong>emotional</strong> content from <strong>each social interaction</strong> and compares it with your past experiences, so you develop and grow <strong>your social skills and social awareness</strong>It “labels” these emotional cues for rapid access so that you <strong>never lose your cool in tense social situations</strong> and <strong>you always know how to react</strong> and <strong>what to say</strong></p>
        <p>But that’s not all. Besides the findings of Dr Matthew Walker there’s another, recently discovered layer to Healing Sleep and that is the clearing of <strong>Sleep Debt</strong>...</p>

        <h2><strong>The Reason Why Your Brain Shrinks Every Night</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Maiken Nedergaard, </strong>is a<strong> Board Certified Medical Doctor, </strong>and<strong> Neuroscientist. </strong>He’s also a co-director of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center.</p>
        <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
          <div><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Mh_U2ulVLl1y1lBD-g-xYtVnqawH7_gF0LUWaxWsBSv0eUdBxrcJpmYaVMjvUGCkmxCzjd1MsO5gH00V_PCSVUZYqNUWWFkTqvkbagEqcauJ84On_76RoZiUInlCNxEF4IMHNfOV"></div>

        <p>[CAPTION: University of Rochester Medical Center]</p>
        <p>And here’s what he had to say about <strong>Healing Sleep</strong>:</p>
        <p><em><strong>“This [Healing Sleep] changes the cellular structure of the brain. It appears to be a completely different state,” </strong></em></p>
        <p>This is after the discoveries he made in a 2013 study funded by the NIH (<strong>National Institute of Health</strong>).</p>
        <p>The study suggests that <strong>Healing Sleep</strong> clears your brain of <strong>Sleep Debt</strong> or damaging molecules associated with neurodegeneration.</p>
        <p>Using mice, researchers saw (for the first time) that the space between brain cells increase by 60% during deep sleep. And this in turn allows the brain to flush out all the toxins that build up during waking hours. </p>
        <p>Here’s what they did, they injected a dye in the the brain of a mouse while it was awake (RIGHT) and then scanned it while the mouse was asleep (LEFT).</p>
        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/awAK_AkouYM">https://youtu.be/awAK_AkouYM</a></p>
        <p>As you can see the brain rapidly flushes all of the dye out during the sleep phase. And this process is even more pronounced during the <strong>stage IV</strong>.</p>
        <p>And <strong>stage IV is part of Healing Sleep</strong>. </p>
        <p>In simple terms, what it means: </p>
        <p>A full night of <strong>Healing Sleep</strong> may literally clear your mind from dangerous substances, poisons and deadly toxins that accumulate in our brain and cause damage to the most precious organ you have. </p>
        <p>And if you get enough Healing Sleep this may <strong>slow</strong> or <strong>prevent</strong> diseases such as: <strong>Alzheimer’s</strong>, <strong>general cognitive decline, cancer</strong> and even <strong>stroke</strong>.</p>
        <p>So now I hope you see the incredible potential of <strong>Healing Sleep</strong>. </p>
        <p><strong>It improves your memory and emotional wellbeing and protects your brain.</strong></p>
        <p>...unfortunately here’s where most people go wrong...</p>
